# Skills

Neme        | Description
---         | ---
Python      | Python is not my first programming language, but it my favorit now. I use it mostly for build web-apps and automation of trivial things. Also, I work with Python standard library as well. I'am always try to do everything according PEP8(I use isort, flake8), implement design patterns and cover my code by unit tests.
Django      | I've got much experience with Django REST Framework. I like this framework because you get all what you need from the box, and extensive library of packages.
Flask       | I like this one, because it's simple, lightweight, you can work more with core Python when developing with Flask, also it's great solution for scalable projects. I think, that Falsk - is my favorit web-framework.
Scrapy      | I've try much ways build solutions for aggregating(parsing) data, and I think, that Scrapy - is the best framework wich solves this problems.
Aiohttp     | I've got some experience with it, and find it very similar with Flask, except async natural. I find Aiohttp very useful to make your IO server faster.
Celery      | I use Celery as tasks queue for async jobs.
JavaScript  | I've got experience with JS on frontend also I can build simple backend.
React       | I've got basic understanding of React. Also I've got less experience with React-Native.
Vue         | I've got some experience with Vue. I find it great solution for little, simple web-apps.
PHP         | I can write simple things in pure PHP, but I actually do it rarely.
MongoDB     | I've got same experience with MongoDB. It useful in bundle with Scrapy.
CouchDB     | It was my first NoSQL DB. The CouchDB has very specific approach to solve specific problems, not convenient for common tasks.
RethinkDB   | I've got much experience with it. I used RethinkDB as convenient DB for work in cluster with python backend.
MySQL       | I can work with raw SQL, CRUD operations and basic setup on a server.
PostgreSQL  | I've got experience same like with MySQL.
Memcached   | Mostly used as cache back-end.
Redis       | Used as cache backend, when needed solution without hash tables data structure.
Bash        | Sometimes I've writing scripts to automation of some routines, scripts of docker entrypoints and scripts for dotfiles management.
Linux       | I've tried many of Linux distributions: Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, ArchLinux, LinuxMint, Debian, Kali, Xubuntu. My favorite now is Xubuntu, becouse it's lightweight, simple and convinient in my case.
Apache      | I can perform basic setup of hosts, configs to show up the world a site.
Nginx       | Usually use as reverse proxy server in many projects.
Gunicorn    | I usually use as Python proxy server with Nginx. I think it's the best solution for web-apps povered by Python.
REST API    | I like REST approachs. I've build much endpoints. I guess I've got a grasp what is resources, methods, headers, query params and status codes.
TDD, BDD    | I'm not adept in this approaches, but they are exciting me.
