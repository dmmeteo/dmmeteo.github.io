# Skills

Name        | Description
---         | ---
Python      | Python is not my first programming language, but it my favorite now. Mostly I usemit for building web-apps and automatization of trivial things. Also I work with Python standard library as well. I always try to do everything according PEP8( using isort, flake8), to implement design patterns and to cover my code by unit tests.
Django      | I've got much experience with Django REST Framework. I like this framework because you get all what you need from the box and extensive library of packages.
Flask       | I like this one, because it's simple and lightweight, you can work more with core Python when developing with Flask, also it's a great solution for scalable projects. I think that Falsk is my favorite web-framework.
Scrapy      | I've tried many ways of building solutions for aggregating(parsing) data and I think that Scrapy is the best framework wich solves this problems.
Aiohttp     | I've got some experience with it and find it very similar with Flask, except it is async. I find Aiohttp very useful to make your IO server faster.
Celery      | I use Celery as tasks queue for async jobs.
Serverless  | I've got basic understanding of FASS approach. Also got some experience in work with AWS Lambda.
JavaScript  | I've got experience with JS on frontend also I can build simple backend using it.
React       | I've got basic understanding of React and some less experience with React-Native.
Vue         | I've got some experience with Vue. I find it great solution for little, simple web-apps.
PHP         | I can write simple things in pure PHP, but I actually do it quite rarely.
Selenium    | I've got some experience working with Selenium-python and Nightwatch.js.
MongoDB     | I've got some experience with MongoDB. It is useful in bundle with Scrapy.
CouchDB     | It was my first NoSQL DB. Though, CouchDB has very specific approach to solve specific problems, not convenient for common tasks.
RethinkDB   | I've got much experience with it. I used RethinkDB as convenient DB for work in cluster with python backend.
MySQL       | I can work with raw SQL, CRUD operations and basic setup on a server.
PostgreSQL  | My experience with PostgreSQL same like with MySQL.
Memcached   | Mostly used as cache back-end.
Redis       | Used as cache backend when solution without hash tables data structure was needed.
Bash        | Constantly I am writing scripts for automatization of some routines, scripts of docker entrypoints and scripts for dotfiles management.
Linux       | I've tried many of Linux distributions: Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, ArchLinux, LinuxMint, Debian, Kali, Xubuntu. For now my favorite is Xubuntu because it's lightweight, simple and convinient for me.
Apache      | I can perform basic setup of hosts, configs to roll out a site.
Nginx       | Usually use as reverse proxy server in many projects.
Gunicorn    | I usually use as Python proxy server with Nginx. I think it's the best solution for web-apps povered by Python.
AWS         | I've got some experience with EC2, S3 and Lambda.
REST API    | I like REST approach. I've build much endpoints. I guess I have enough experience in things like resources, methods, headers, query params and status codes.
TDD, BDD    | I'm not adept in this approaches, but they excite me alot.


# Development tools

Neme        | Description
---         | ---
Vim         | My favorite IDE for now. I use it for all projects on daily basis. I've extend Vim with SpaceVim distribution that is why i call it IDE.
Tmux        | Usually use in bundle with Vim. I can't imagine work in terminal without tmux.
IPython     | Usually use this powerful tool for quik tests of some language constructions.
VSCode      | It was my favorite IDE in the past.
SublimeText | I like to use this handy and fast IDE for small tasks. I've used it on daily basis.
JetBrains   | I used WebStorm, PhpStorm, PyCharm and CLion but this apps are so hardweight and not convenient for me.
Supervisor  | I use it as processes controller and runner. 
Fabric      | I use it to automate the deployment process.
Docker      | I can build an image and create docker-compose config. I use it on daily basis.
Git         | Use it everywhere on daily basis with Github.
Mercurial   | I have much experience with this SCV but prefer to use Git.
Heroku      | Usually use to serve my pet-projects.
